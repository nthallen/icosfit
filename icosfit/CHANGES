3.00: 01/17/2018
  Rewrite to improve the ability to share parameters and incorporate
  new functional forms. Created func_paramater class so functions
  no longer need to know whether their arguments are functions or
  parameters.

2.25: 07/25/2017
 Added support for additional isotopologues:
 NO, NO2, OH, HCHO

2.24: 09/10/2016
 Added support for HCl

2.23: 02/11/2015
 Fixed rounding problem in ICOSfile::wn_sample
 which caused assertion failures.
 Added explicit failure on non-decreasing tuning rate.
 Reconfigured handle_restart() to allow skipping problematic scans.
 
2.22: 02/01/2015
 Fixed bug in 64-bit versions where background was
 miscalculated and scan data was shifted. Scan data
 was shifted 5 samples left when scans were loaded.
 If the BackgroundRegion was within 5 samples of laser
 turn on, the zero baseline value was miscalculated,
 resulting in elevated concentrations. The shifting
 would also match features to the wrong tuning rate,
 but we expect that difference to be offsetting and
 much smaller than the zero baseline error.
 
2.21: 12/03/2014
 Added support for etalon feedback parameters.

2.20: 05/14/2014
 Added the ability to include scan-by-scan mirror loss in the
 PTEfile format.

2.19: 09/14/2013
 Fixed bug introduced in 2.18 causing negative numbers in the
 config file to be syntax errors. 

2.18: 09/13/2013
 Added support for additional columns in input PTEfiles.
 Accept '-' characters in PATH strings.

2.17: 08/22/2013
 Changed output file format, eliminating unused output columns
 and adding output columns required to reproduce rrfit-style
 plots without verbose output. This allows verbosity to be set
 to zero without losing information. Currently Matlab fit_view
 can replace rrfit for Herriott cell data, but support for ICOS
 can't be too far behind.
 Fixed off-by-one error reading SSP files. Input scans had been
 shifted right by one sample with a spurious point added as
 the first sample.

2.16: 07/01/2013
 Added small hysteresis in line_check to avoid endless loop

2.15: 06/05/2013
 Table lookup for Q(T) to support molecules other than H2O
 away from Tref = 296K.
 Additional configuration parameters for fit convergence testing.

2.14: 05/28/2013
 Revert pressure shift changes originally introduced in version 2.10.

2.13: 05/13/2013
 Re-corrected the pressure dependence of line positions. Previous
 versions had a sign error.

2.12: 12/23/2012
 Added Left and Right LineMargin options

2.11: 12/21/2012
 Added support for SSP format files

2.10: 11/30/2012
 Corrected the pressure shift calculation.
 
2.9: 11/27/2012
 Added CavityFixedLength and LineMarginMultiplier

2.8: 11/09/2012
 Removed most references to 'CPCI'

2.7.2: 10/28/2012
 Moved to arp-icosfit project
 Added several isotopologues of CO2 needed for the Harvard
 Carbon Isotopes Instrument.
 
2.7.1: 9/11/2011
 Fixed minor printf format problems revealed by -Wall
 Added CFLAGS to generated Makefile to ensure use of -O2

2.7: 6/15/2011
 Resolved "const char" issues

2.6:
 Added additional values to get_molwt() for Isotopes of
 CO2, N2O and CH4.

2.5:
 Support for BaselineFile = PATH + Input; for HHH

2.4:
 ptread.c Support for empty zero region

2.3a:
 funceval.c: get_molwt() Added molecular weights for CO2 and NO2

2.3:
 Added funcnoskew.c for Herriott cell absorption,
  triggered by definition of N_Passes > 0
 Added support for running on big-endian
  architectures
 Added annotated parameter dump on failure

2.2 incorporates support for the baseline perturbation input file.
  2.2a fixes a problem with the icos_getrun script under cygwin
  2.2b Added retrieval of quickcpci tgz to icos_get*
  2.2c Added nu0 keyword to configuration file
  2.2d Fixes a problem when fitting against a fixed nu_F0
  2.2e Abbreviates stdoutput and adds some useful information
       to ICOSconfig.m
  2.2f Add --RestartAt commandline option
  2.2g Changed baseline file format for non-polynomial fits
