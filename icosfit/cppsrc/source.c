/* Source text buffering.  (See Waite, W. M. "The Cost of Lexical Analysis"
 * Software - Practice and Experience, 16 (May, 1986) 473-488.)
 * The input file is assumed to be ASCII, with no embedded NULs.
 *
 * Designed to be fast, and guarantee that full lines are always in memory.
 * The idea is to read text into a buffer and then to find the last newline
 * by scanning in reverse from the end of the buffer.  The character
 * following that newline is saved and replaced by NUL to mark the end of
 * the usable text.  (An extra position is reserved in the buffer in case
 * the last newline is the last character read.)
 *
 * If there is no newline in the buffer after it has been filled, then
 * space is reallocated for a larger buffer and another block of input is
 * read and stored immediately after the previous text.  If the end of the
 * file is reached without reading a newline, then a newline is added at
 * the end of the text.
 *
 * Client routines of the source module can assume that a complete line,
 * with its terminating newline, is in the buffer.  If the character
 * following the terminating newline is NUL, then refillBuf must be called
 * to obtain additional information.  (If the character following the
 * terminating newline is not NUL, then the module guarantees that the next
 * line, with its associated newline, is already in the buffer.)
 *
 * When refillBuf is called, the buffer generally contains the head of a
 * partial line that follows the last complete line.  This partial line
 * must be concatenated with the new text read, because the new text is the
 * continuation of the partial line.  The buffer is therefore divided into
 * two parts:
 */
#define READBUF (SrcBuffer->memblock+SrcBuffer->maxline)
/*
 *   memblock		 READBUF
 *	 |		 |
 *	|---------------|---------------------------------------------------|
 *	| <--maxline-->	|  <--------readsiz ----------------------------->  |
 *	|	^	|				^	^	    |
 *	|TEXTSTART	|			     charend  READBUF+count |
 *	|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
 *
 * The left part of the buffer, of size maxline, is the "partial line area"
 * and the right part, of size readsiz, is the "read area".  Initially,
 * text is read into the read area.  The number of characters read is saved
 * as the value of "count", and "charend" is set to point to the NUL that
 * is stored after the newline terminating the last full line.  When the
 * buffer is refilled, the partial line is first copied to the partial line
 * area so that its last character is in the last character position of
 * that area.  Then text is read, starting at the beginning of the read
 * area.  This strategy performs the concatenation as cheaply as possible.
 * 
 * The basic strategy outlined above must be modified slightly because the
 * interface to refillBuf permits it to be called with a pointer to ANY
 * character position in the buffer.  The intent of such a call is to add
 * new text (if there is any in the file) to the string that begins at the
 * specified character and includes the partial line at the end of the
 * buffer.  This string may be very long, and may actually begin in the
 * partial line area.
 *
 * The modified strategy is to move the existing contents of the buffer to
 * the left if necessary to guarantee that it begins in the partial line
 * area, and to read text into the first unoccupied character position.
